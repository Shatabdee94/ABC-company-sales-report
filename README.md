Project Description:

"Sales Analysis Project: Analyzing Revenue, Profit, and Customer Insights in a Retail Environment

In this project, I conducted an in-depth sales analysis using a dataset obtained from Kaggle.com. The dataset provided comprehensive information on sales transactions, enabling me to gain valuable insights and make data-driven recommendations. Here are some key highlights from my analysis:

Determining Order Priority Impact: I investigated the correlation between order priority levels and income, revealing whether higher priority levels result in higher income.

Identifying Profitable Categories: I analyzed the different product categories to identify which one yielded the highest profit, contributing to strategic decision-making for the business.

Regional Sub-Category Analysis: By examining each region individually, I determined the most frequently purchased sub-category in each region, aiding in targeted marketing efforts.

Customer Evaluation: I assessed the overall customer satisfaction and loyalty by examining various factors such as order quantity, order priority, and segment distribution.

Segment Distribution by Region: I analyzed how customer segments were distributed across different regions, providing insights into the market and enabling region-specific marketing strategies.

Quantifying Order Quantity: I identified the region with the highest order quantity, assisting in inventory management and resource allocation.

Order Priority Distribution: I examined the distribution of order priority levels within each region, highlighting patterns and enabling better order processing strategies.

Profitable and Unprofitable Products: I determined the names of products that yielded the highest profit as well as those that resulted in losses for the store, guiding product assortment and pricing strategies.

Sales, Profit, and Profit Margin Analysis: I conducted a comprehensive analysis of sales, profit contribution, and profit margin, identifying the top 5 customers with the highest sales, profit contribution, and profit margin. Additionally, I flagged customers that were detrimental to the business.

Most Profitable Category and Subcategory: I identified the most profitable category and subcategory, enabling focused efforts to maximize profitability.

Profit to Order Quantity Ratio by Region: I calculated the profit-to-order quantity ratio for each region, providing insights into the regional profitability landscape.

Trending Items in Each Region: I determined the trending items in each region, allowing for targeted marketing campaigns and inventory management.

Based on my analysis, I have several suggestions for business improvement:

Implement coupon or discount strategies to attract new customers with fewer than 10 orders.
Focus on trending products specific to each region to leverage market demand.
Offer additional incentives or discounts to loyal customers to reinforce their trust and encourage repeat business.
